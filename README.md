#How to use
1. Add QuartzCore.framework to your project.
2. Copy `OTNotification` to your project.
3. import "OTNotification.h"
4. call notification APIs. e.g.

```
    OTNotificationManager *notificationManager = [OTNotificationManager defaultManager];
    OTNotificationMessage *notificationMessage = [[OTNotificationMessage alloc] init];
    notificationMessage.title = [self notificationTitle];
    notificationMessage.message = @"A notification. Touch me to hide me.";
    [notificationManager postNotificationMessage:notificationMessage];
```

More API usage in `OTNotificationDemo/ViewController.m`

If your app's status bar is hidden, you should manually set message window's orientation in `OTNotificationManager`'s methods:

```
//Manual rotate
- (void)setWindowOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)o;
- (void)setWindowOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)o
                    animated:(BOOL)animated;
- (void)setWindowOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)o
                    animated:(BOOL)animated
           animationDuration:(NSTimeInterval)animationDuration;
```

#Modules
*  Use [OTScreenshotHelper](https://github.com/OpenFibers/OTScreenshotHelper) to make screenshots of views and status bar.
*  Use [OTCubeRotateView](https://github.com/OpenFibers/OTCubeRotateView) to do cube rotate animation.
